                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I found that all UI design will add the sense of animation when scrolling the web page. When the user's control can make the web page move and have enough animation sense, the user will have a sense of accomplishment. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> What I think is good about this web page is that it shows the summary of recent web pages directly to the reader, so I can easily see and draw common conclusions. It is up to the readers to do their own aggregation. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I think one of my favorite items is Nike's shoe display, a page where you can directly replace the product you are looking to buy and see his color scheme. I think this allows consumers to visualize the results of their purchases. This provided the inspiration for the design of my own personal online store. </p>
