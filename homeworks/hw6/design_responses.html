						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In this article, I learned about the adequacy of animation speed. First of all, the speed can not be too fast or too slow, preferably in 200-500ms. The second concern is that apps will have different durations on different devices. The larger the screen, the greater the duration, so that it will be more appropriate. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What I find most interesting in this article is one of the pictures, a comparison of animation speed using animal movements. I think what we beginners need most is contrast learning, and I often change parameters while writing code to understand specific changes. When I observed this picture, I deeply realized how fast is the appropriate animation speed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “But. Forget about these rules if you are creating a decorative animation on your website or trying to attract the user’s attention to certain elements. In these cases, animation can be longer.” </p>
						</li>
