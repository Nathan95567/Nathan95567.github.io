                    <li>What is something you learned from this article? (2-3 sentences)</li>
                    <p>Ans:In the article, the author uses the software we often use every day to explain. By gradually reconstructing the software in the animation, we can think about the original software design that we use daily for a reason, which makes me learn how to learn software design, not just use software.</p>

                    <li>What was your favorite part of this article? (2-3 sentences)</li>
                    <p>Ans: I think the idea of this article is very much in line with my idea, now there are many web templates have been edited, as long as the fee can create a personal website, but if we do not really learn html, we can not understand how to really design their own website. For example, in the search bar "Try London", this design caught my eyes, which I did not realize when I used the software.</p>
