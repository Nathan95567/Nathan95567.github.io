					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think I have gained the most important knowledge at the beginning of this article. I always thought that design is to make the picture more beautiful and comfortable, but I did not think of the deeper meaning. I have never considered the feelings of color blind people. Every time I have a physical examination, I will be glad that I am not color blind, but I have never felt the world of color blindness. Through color matching, as many people as possible can also feel the beauty of design, which really makes design bring very meaningful things. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think what I learned in this post that struck me was that failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding accessibility can also lead to potential legal consequences. I was not aware that failure to open the website could also result in legal liability. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
