						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Learning web design for so long, this is the first time I received theoretical knowledge about design. The Gestalt principles mentioned on the website and the button planning based on this theory have made me understand the beauty of design. If I had read this article before the midterms, I would have designed it better than if I had just copied the existing website. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In my opinion, the most interesting feature of this article is its flexible use of Gestalt principles. In the following examples, it can be seen that the author marked the position of each circle to tell the reader where the same position should be in web design. I think this way is very convenient for me to understand.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience. " </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
